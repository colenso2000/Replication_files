October 2008

The D6 Factor increased from –5.5 percent in August (measured on a year-over-year basis) to –4.6 percent in September. (The historical trend growth rate is normalized to zero in the chart). The gain was largely due to increases in the 12-month growth rates in housing starts and housing permits that took place in all Sixth District states except Louisiana. Nevertheless, the current reading is still more than 1.5 percentage points lower than the previous two cyclical troughs in May 1991 and November 2001.
