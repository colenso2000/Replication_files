February 2009

In December, the D6 Factor remained at –6.7 percent (on a year-over-year basis) (unchanged from the revised November reading; see "About the D6 Factor" for more about data revisions). The indicator fell a record 1.8 percentage points in November. This sharp drop reflects the recent broad-based declines seen in Sixth District economic data. In both November and December, at least 80 percent of the series used to construct the D6 Factor had readings that were lower than two months earlier.
